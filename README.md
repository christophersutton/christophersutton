# Hi, hiring manager

If you're here it's likely because you saw me in a stack of applications. If that's you, just want to make clear that the activity shown here is a just a fraction of my engineering output. Between Bitbucket, client account requirements, and nightly backups for personal projects, lots of my work never ends up tied to this account.
