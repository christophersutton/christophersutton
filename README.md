# Hi, hiring manager

If you're here it's likely because you saw me in a stack of applications. If that's you, I'd like you to know two things:
1. The activity shown here is a just a fraction of my engineering output. Between Bitbucket, client account requirements, and nightly backups for personal projects, lots of my work never ends up tied to this account.
2. Given #1 above, I've decided to build a prototype project here in public for you. Check out [Resume Ralph](https://github.com/christophersutton/resume-ralph) - it's probably the reason my resume got to you in the first place.
